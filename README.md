# Password-Generator Overview

    This is a symple password generator. This program utilizes DOM Manipulation and Javascript to function. This program gives the user the ability to decide a password length from 8 to 128. The user is then prompted to choose between having a combination of lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers and special characters. All of these variables are tooken into account by the js code, and used to create a simple password algorithm. Once a password has been generated it populates in the text area of the password generator UI. This is a simple program that can be used by anyone.

# Results

    The prompts work perfectly, and also provides fallbacks for inproper inputs. The syntax was written in very clean way, with lots of comments. I was able to complete this project in just 5 hours, and for my first project like this, I am very proud of the results. 

# Problems

    I wanted to convert the prompt strings into lowercase values ensuring the users would be able to type in yes with capital letters, and the program would still return true, but I wasn't able to implement this in the time frame I was given. This will likely be included in a future update.
